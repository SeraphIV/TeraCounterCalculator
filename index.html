          This tool will suggest a tera type for a pokemon based on it's typing.
        </p>
        <p>
          It will find the types that you're weak against and suggest types that
          cover that weakness. (ex: Normal is weak to Fighting, Fighting is weak
          to Flying/Psychic/Fairy, so the tool will suggest those three)
        </p>
        <p>
          If your weaknesses are covered by a single type multiple times, the
          count will be listed as well. (ex: Dragon is weak to Ice/Fairy and
          those are both weak to Steel, so the tool will note that Steel covers
          2 weaknesses)
        </p>
